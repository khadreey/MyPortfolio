  <stronghold>A user persona is a semi-fictional character based on your current (or ideal) customer. Personas can be created by talking to users and segmenting by various demographic and psychographic data to improve your product marketing.</stronghold>
  <stronghold>I created this User Persona for to develop a solution for a farmer located in a area with bad roads and long distance to the market, trying to sell his farm products. On the receiving side a wife who works 6-5 as a banker and still has to pick up her kids and prepare meal for them, and her husband who works late. She's trying to get easier ways to shop for quality goods that can stay fresh up tp a week so she can store in the house. That way she won't have to stop by at the market everyday which will reduce her workload.</stronghold>
